## Code Spelunking: Teach Yourself How Rails Works

Have you ever wondered how something works deep in the guts of Rails or been stuck when a README says one thing but the code acts another way? Guides and docs are often the best way to get started but when they fall short, you may need to get your hands dirty.

Using method introspection, this talk will show you ways to confidently explore Rails code. By looking at common problems inspired by real-world situations, learn how to dive into Rails and teach yourself how any feature works under-the-hood.

Letâ€™s go spelunking!

## Ten Years of Rails Upgrades

Upgrading Rails can go from easy-to-hard quickly. If you've struggled to upgrade to a new version of Rails, you're not alone. And yet, with useful deprecation warnings and extensive beta periods, Rails has never made it easier to upgrade. So what makes it hard?

By looking at the past ten years of Rails upgrades at Clio (and other notable apps), let's see what we can learn. Gain insight into the tradeoffs between different timelines and approaches and learn practical ways to keep your app up-to-date.
