Hi! 👋🏻

I'm Jordan Raine. I work at [Clio](https://clio.com), where I write code to keep our products fast and maintainable. I love improving existing systems and helping others find more productive ways to do their work.

I enjoy speaking and recently had the chance to [do so at RailsConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aCfc0DkSFo). I've also been [a guest chef on RubyTapas](https://www.rubytapas.com/2018/08/13/ruby-spelunking/).

Before my life as a software developer, I wrote and performed music in [Young Liars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFoqL3F6r7w).
